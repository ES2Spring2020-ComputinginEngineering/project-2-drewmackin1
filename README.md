This project is based on an example and dataset from Data Science course developed at Berkeley (Data8.org).

The NearestNeighbor classification code is able to be run by itself and can be copied into spyder and run once the path is changed to the path that would function on the user's computer and it requires that the user have a csv file called "ckd.csv" that is accessible by the path. 

I wrote the K-means clustering all on one file, so the K-meansClustering_Functions includes all the code that is in the driver and should be run by itself. I have not tested the code in the driver to see if it functions because it is much simpler to just run the code in the functions folder. As with the NearestNeighbor, the user of the code must change the path in order for the code to be able to access the csv file required to run the code. 


For function overviews in each file please see the comments in the code as well as the report.
